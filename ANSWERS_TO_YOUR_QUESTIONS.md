# Answers to Your Questions

## Question 1: Is preprocessing working correctly?

### Short Answer
**Yes** for image files, **No** for PDFs (and that's correct by design).

### Detailed Explanation

#### ✅ For Image Files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp)

When you enable preprocessing in `.env`:
```ini
MISTRAL_ENABLE_IMAGE_PREPROCESSING=true
MISTRAL_ENABLE_IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION=true
MISTRAL_IMAGE_QUALITY_THRESHOLD=100
```

The system now:
1. **Preprocesses** the image (contrast +50%, sharpness +30%)
2. **Optimizes** the image (resizes if > 2048px, compresses to quality=100)
3. **Uploads** the processed image to Mistral
4. **Processes** with OCR

**Your JPEG quality=100 setting IS being used** for standalone image files.

#### ❌ For PDF Files (.pdf)

Preprocessing does **NOT** apply to PDFs because:
- PDFs are uploaded as complete documents
- Mistral OCR processes PDFs natively (doesn't convert to images first)
- PDF pages can contain vector graphics, text layers, embedded fonts
- Converting to images would lose quality

**What Actually Happens with PDFs:**
```
PDF → Upload to Mistral → OCR processes PDF directly → Extract text
```

**NOT:**
```
PDF → Convert to images → Preprocess → Upload → OCR
```

### How to Preprocess PDFs (If Needed)

If you want to preprocess PDF pages:

**Option 1: Manual Two-Step Process**
```bash
# Step 1: Convert PDF to images (Mode 7)
python main.py --mode pdf_to_images
# Creates: output_images/filename_pages/page_001.png, page_002.png, etc.

# Step 2: Move images to input/ and process with Mode 4
# With preprocessing enabled, images will be enhanced before OCR
```

**Option 2: Use Mode 3 for Text-Based PDFs**
```bash
# Much faster and often more accurate for text-layer PDFs
python main.py --mode markitdown
```

## Question 2: Is max_tokens supported by Mistral OCR API?

### Short Answer
**NO** - `max_tokens` is NOT supported by the Mistral OCR API.

### Detailed Explanation

The Mistral API has **two different endpoints** with different parameters:

#### ❌ Chat Completion API (NOT what we use)
```python
# This endpoint supports temperature, max_tokens, language
response = client.chat.complete(
    model="mistral-large-latest",
    messages=[...],
    temperature=0.7,      # ✅ Supported here
    max_tokens=1000,      # ✅ Supported here
    language="en"         # ✅ Supported here
)
```

#### ✅ OCR API (what we actually use)
```python
# This endpoint does NOT support temperature, max_tokens, language
response = client.ocr.process(
    model="mistral-ocr-latest",
    document=document,
    include_image_base64=True,  # ✅ Supported
    pages=[0, 1],                # ✅ Supported
    # temperature=0.0,           # ❌ NOT supported - causes error
    # max_tokens=16384,          # ❌ NOT supported - causes error
    # language="auto",           # ❌ NOT supported - causes error
)
```

### Why the Confusion?

The original documentation (and my initial implementation) **incorrectly assumed** the OCR endpoint would accept the same parameters as the chat endpoint. 

This was based on:
- Looking at Mistral's chat API documentation
- Assuming feature parity
- Not testing with actual OCR API calls

### What We Discovered

When you ran Mode 4, we got this error:
```
ERROR: Ocr.process() got an unexpected keyword argument 'temperature'
```

This revealed the truth: **OCR endpoint has its own parameter set.**

### What Actually Works

**Supported by Mistral OCR API:**
| Parameter | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `model` | string | Model to use (mistral-ocr-latest) |
| `document` | object | Document to process |
| `include_image_base64` | bool | Extract images |
| `pages` | list[int] | Specific pages to process |
| `bbox_annotation_format` | object | Bounding box extraction |
| `document_annotation_format` | object | Document-level extraction |
| `retries` | object | Retry configuration |

**NOT Supported:**
- ❌ `temperature` - OCR is deterministic by default
- ❌ `max_tokens` - OCR processes full documents
- ❌ `language` - OCR auto-detects all languages
- ❌ `top_p` - Not applicable to OCR
- ❌ `stream` - OCR returns complete results

### Good News!

The OCR API is actually **better** than we thought:

1. **Always Deterministic**
   - You wanted temperature=0 for reproducible results
   - OCR is **always** deterministic - same document always gives same output
   - No configuration needed!

2. **No Token Limits**
   - You set max_tokens=16384 to avoid truncation
   - OCR processes **full documents** without limits
   - No configuration needed!

3. **Smart Language Detection**
   - You set language="auto"
   - OCR **automatically** handles all languages
   - No configuration needed!

## What to Remove from Your .env

These variables do nothing (OCR API doesn't use them):

```ini
# You can remove these - they have no effect
MISTRAL_OCR_TEMPERATURE=0.0
MISTRAL_OCR_MAX_TOKENS=16384
MISTRAL_OCR_LANGUAGE=auto
```

### What to Keep

These variables ARE used:

```ini
# Keep these - they actually work
MISTRAL_API_KEY="your_key"
MISTRAL_OCR_MODEL="mistral-ocr-latest"
MISTRAL_INCLUDE_IMAGES=true
SAVE_MISTRAL_JSON=true
CLEANUP_OLD_UPLOADS=true
UPLOAD_RETENTION_DAYS=7

# Image preprocessing (for image files only, NOT PDFs)
MISTRAL_ENABLE_IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION=true
MISTRAL_ENABLE_IMAGE_PREPROCESSING=true
MISTRAL_IMAGE_QUALITY_THRESHOLD=100
MISTRAL_MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION=2048
```

## Why Quality Score is Low (20/100)

Your trial balance PDF is getting a low score because the quality checker:

1. **Expects lots of text** - Financial tables have mostly numbers
2. **Counts digits** - May not detect table-formatted numbers correctly
3. **Checks uniqueness** - Repeated column headers trigger warnings

### Solution

For your trial balance PDF, **use Mode 3 (MarkItDown Only)** instead:

```bash
python main.py --mode markitdown
```

**Why Mode 3 is Better for This:**
- ✅ Your PDF has a text layer (text_based=True)
- ✅ MarkItDown extracts text directly (no OCR needed)
- ✅ Faster (1-2 seconds vs 36 seconds)
- ✅ Free (no API costs)
- ✅ Often more accurate for text-layer PDFs

**Or use Mode 1 (HYBRID):**
- Gets tables from camelot (already extracted 3 tables!)
- Gets text from MarkItDown
- Adds OCR for comprehensive analysis
- Creates combined output with all results

---

## Summary

### Your Settings
```ini
MISTRAL_IMAGE_QUALITY_THRESHOLD=100
MISTRAL_ENABLE_IMAGE_PREPROCESSING=true
```

**Effect on PDFs:** None (preprocessing doesn't apply to PDFs)  
**Effect on Images:** Full preprocessing + maximum quality  
**Recommendation:** Keep for image files, use Mode 3 for text PDFs

### Best Mode for Your Document

**20197- TB December 2010.pdf** (Trial Balance)

Since the log shows:
- `text_based=True` - Has text layer
- 2 pages
- Camelot extracted 3 tables successfully

**Recommended:** Mode 1 (HYBRID) or Mode 3 (MarkItDown)
- Mode 3: Fast, free, accurate for text
- Mode 1: Gets tables + text + OCR (comprehensive)

**Not Recommended:** Mode 4 (OCR Only)
- Slower
- Costs money
- Low quality score for this document type
- Text extraction is better for text-layer PDFs

---

## Final Answer

1. **Preprocessing:** ✅ NOW works for images, ❌ doesn't apply to PDFs (by design)
2. **max_tokens:** ❌ NOT supported by OCR API (verified and removed from code)
3. **Your PDF:** Use Mode 3 or Mode 1, not Mode 4
